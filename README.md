# Heart-Detection
The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision model that automatically detects and draws a bounding box around the heart in chest X-ray images. This tool assists radiologists and medical professionals by highlighting the heart region for quicker and more accurate diagnosis of cardiac-related conditions.
